A fairly new feature in GitKraken is AI generated commit messages. And like most things with GitKraken it's easy as 1-2-3!

<h4>Step 1</h4>

Make changes to the source code in your repo and stage them.

<h4>Step 2</h4>

Click the "Generate commit message with AI" button in the bottom right corner

And then, voilá!

After analyzing your code changes, GitKraken has now generated a commit message and description. If the message is correct and to your liking, just click commit to add your
changes to a commit on your current branch! You can also change the suggested text if you want to.

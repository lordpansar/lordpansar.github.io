I thought I'd take a minute to reflect on and go through some highlights from Leetspeak 2018.

Please note that these are just my personal opinions. The sessions that I don't mention weren't inferior in any way,
but in this blog post I've decided to focus on the ones who stood out to a little bit extra to me.

In case you haven't heard about it before, [Leetspeak][leetspeak-2018] is a single day, single track dev conference
for developers, by developers. The conference is arranged by [tretton37][tretton37-link] and I think it's a really 
cozy and intimate conference, delivering high quality content. The tickets are only 200 Swedish krona (roughly 20 €)
 and always takes place on a saturday, so you don't need to take time off from work in order to attend.

<h1>Sessions</h1>

<h4>Why I'm not leaving .NET - Mark Rendle</h4>

Mark Rendle took the stage with his talk "Why I'm not leaving .NET". A counter action to all the blog posts
that people feel urged to write when they're leaving .NET, telling the world why they're doing it. In the
session, Mark went over a couple of .NET-related techniques and frameworks that he sees as good reasons to
keep working in .NET.

Besides Mark being a fun and charismatic speaker, the session stood out thanks to Mark co-presenting
the session together with his daughter, Willow. Willow joined Mark on stage for the final segment of the
talk, doing a live demo in Unity. Kudos to you Willow, I'd never had the courage to do something like that
when I was in your age!

<h4>Apps, algorithms and abstractions: decoding our digital world - Dylan Beattie</h4>

Dylan Beattie deboned what actually happens when you send someone a cat picture. From when the
light is reflected from the cat and into the camera lense, how the image is processed and optimized and
sent via different protocols to the recieving device. Dylan explained these complex concepts and technologies
that all of us take for granted in a humorous and pedagogical way.

Starting with the absolut lowest of fis, via comparing image processing to a swedish [smörgåstårta][smorgastarta].
Dylan used the audience as a barometer for how many ingredients you can remove and still call it a smörgåstårta. 
Spoiler: you can safely remove up to 73% of the ingredients before the dish is no longer considered a smörgåstårta.
The mayonnaise is really what makes or break it.

<h4>Mob programming and the power of flow - Woody Zuill</h4>

Watching Woody talk is always a pleasure. It doesn't really matter what his session is about.
If he's talking, I'm there to listen. Working in IT since the early 1980's, Woody has gained
a tremendous knowledge of how to make dev teams work efficiently and deliver value. For many
he's mainly known as a strong advocate for mob programming and the no estimates movement.

Being the humble man that he is, Woody clearly states in his talk that he's not here to tell us what
to do, but to inspire us by telling us what he did.

The thing that I brought with me from his session is how I can think about and minimize disruptions
in work flow. For example: one of the most commons flow disruptions is being impeded by waiting for
 information or a clarification from someone else. If we can minimize these times of stand still, we
 can go back to doing what we want to do - write code and deliver value to our clients and employers.
